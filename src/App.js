      <h4>
        The Statue of Liberty's original torch is getting a new home.
      </h4>
      <p>
        Made of copper and gold so that it would shine bright, the first torch took a beating from the weather and was replaced<br/>
        by a replica in <time dateTime="1984">1984</time>. It's been stored in the statue's pedestal ever since.
      </p>
      <p>
        But visitors will be able to see the original 3,600-pound torch in all its glory at a new Statue of Liberty Museum, which<br/>
        will open on Liberty Island in <time dateTime="2019-05">May 2019</time>. The torch was transported there by truck <time dateTime="2018-11">last week</time>, along with a replica model<br/>
        of Lady Liberty's face.
      </p>
      <p>
        <q lang="en">Although it is not one of the most difficult things we have ever moved,</q> says Douglas Phelps, who oversaw the<br/>
        relocation of the torch, <q lang="en">it is certainly the most important.</q>

      <h4>
        The history of the Statue of Liberty
      </h4>
      <p>
        Not only is the Statue of Liberty the symbol of New York City, she is also a <abbr title="United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization">UNESCO</abbr> World Heritage site under the<br/>
        designation of <em>Outstanding Universal Value</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her full name is Liberty Enlightening the World, and she was designed by Frederic Auguste Bartholdi and built by<br/>
        Gustave Eiffel -- yes, the same guy who built Paris's Eiffel Tower.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lady Liberty was a gift from France to the United States to celebrate the centennial of their nation's independence --<br/>
        although, somewhat awkwardly, she arrived a decade too late. Nevertheless, President Grover Cleveland formally<br/>
        unveiled her in <time dateTime="1886">1886</time>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then, the statue has served as a symbol of hope and possibility for many people who entered the United States<br/>
        as immigrants via neighboring Ellis Island.
      </p>
      <p>
        <q lang="en">The original torch is a beautiful object of art and exemplifies the American ideals of freedom and democracy,</q> says<br/>
        John Piltzecker, superintendent of the Statue of Liberty National Monument. That symbolic spirit inspired the decision<br/>
        to inscribe these famous lines on the statue's pedestal: <q lang="en">Give me your tired, your poor / Your huddled masses yearning<br/>
        to breathe free.</q>
      </p>
      <p>
        In <time dateTime="2017">2017</time>, nearly 4.5 million people visited Liberty Island.
      </p>
      <p>
        When completed, the Statue of Liberty Museum will be 26,000 square feet of history, inspiration and deeper analysis of<br/>
        the statue's symbolism both in the US and around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        The inspiration gallery, which is where the torch will live, will have floor-to-ceiling glass windows looking out at Lower<br/>
        Manhattan, including the World Trade Center.
